# 👋 Hi, I'm Tanishq Mehta

Backend-heavy **Full Stack Developer** with a strong focus on **scalable systems, performance optimization, and developer tooling**.  
Currently working at **VISA**, building and optimizing backend services using **Java, Spring Boot, Hazelcast, Kafka**, and cloud-native infrastructure.

I enjoy working close to the metal of systems — **query optimization, distributed caches, workflows, and internal platforms** — while also experimenting with **agentic systems, MCP-based tooling, and AI-assisted dev infra**.

## 🧑‍💻 Current Role

### 💳 Software Engineer @ VISA
**Tech Stack:**  
`Java` · `Spring Boot` · `Hazelcast` · `Kafka` · `PostgreSQL` · `Jenkins` · `Git`

**What I work on:**
- Designing and optimizing **high-throughput backend services**
- **Query optimization** and performance tuning in production systems
- Building **internal developer tools** to improve engineering velocity
- Working with **distributed caching (Hazelcast)** and async workflows
- Improving reliability and observability in large-scale systems

## 🧪 Side Projects & Explorations

### 🤖 Agentic & MCP Experiments
- Building **agent-based workflows** using **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**
- Exploring:
  - Tool-using agents
  - Autonomous task decomposition
  - LLM + backend service orchestration
- Focused on **practical developer productivity**, not demos

> Repos are intentionally experimental — I like learning in public.
